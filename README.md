## CONCEPTUAL UI DESIGN

With this kinda like Showcase, i would suggest just this clean look, how Reflex could look like!

- CLEAN
- THEMABLE (JUST THE COLORS & ICONS)
- BUT WITH A MUCH MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD WORKFLOW

THIS IS FROM A DEVIANART USER CALLED bannax1994

This could be an example Of the new UI Design

 + Everything is in the sidebar, where u can find everything u need to build and Render, via a dropdown menu
 + Sidebar can be stay left or on the right of the main rendering window "panel"!
