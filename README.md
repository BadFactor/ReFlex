+ Parallel Coding, Multithreading
+ Without OpenGL Rendering or compatibilty or such "nonsense" stuff

+ MAC OS
+ WINDOWS

## Features

+ 3d printing

## CONCEPTUAL UI DESIGN

With this kinda like Showcase, i would suggest just this clean look, how Reflex could look like!

- CLEAN
- THEMABLE (JUST THE COLORS & ICONS)
- BUT WITH A MUCH MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD WORKFLOW
